## They Came Up With Three Conclusions:

1. Teams that finish one assignment generally complete others and those who don't complete one project will not finish others.
2. Teams whose members spoke about equally usually did very well, and if only one person or a small group did the talking, the ***"collective intelligence declined."**
3. Team with people with ***"average social activities"*** or who can read other people's emotions based on body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice do better. Google then concluded that an informal team with people sensitive and emphatic to others does the best work.
